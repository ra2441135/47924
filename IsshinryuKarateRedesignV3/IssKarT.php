        <p style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">The following Translations were borrowed with the permission of a great Web Site, I requested permission to use the "Translations" and received permission with the request that I would give credit to their site... Well as we were retyping and editing and adding and subtracting. I lost the Site to whom I owe the credit for this page of Translations. First, my apologies. Secondly, if anyone that reads this page can please advise me of the site I will do the following... 1. Apologize and 2. Give proper credit where it is due.</p>
